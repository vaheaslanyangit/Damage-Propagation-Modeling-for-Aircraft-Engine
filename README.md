# Damage-Propagation-Modeling-for-Aircraft-Engine
This notebook models damage propagation in aircraft engines using machine learning. It preprocesses data, applies scaling, and trains models like Random Forest, Linear Regression, LSTM, and XGBoost. Metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² evaluate performance. It leverages Keras, Scikit-learn, and visualization tools for insights.
